 <h2>Time Line</h2>
1. Analysis of problems / Extraction of data<br>
<p class="tab1">1. Motion and properties of a single object</p>
<!--1. Given properties (velocity, mass, friction), locations-->
<!--2. Interactions between objects (collisions, tension)-->
<!--3. Environment (gravity, levels, grounds, ceilings)-->
<!--2. Connecting data and translating to use physics engine to solve-->
<!--3. Displaying output-->
<!--1. Moving objects-->
<!--2. Displaying calculations-->
<!--4. Getting incremental output and working out visualization-->
<!--5. Local data storage-->
<!--1. Store history of problems previously entered.-->
<!--6. Expansions optimizations-->
<!--1. myScript type of interface-->
<!--2. Equation solver-->
<!--1. Would directly use physics engine function to solve equations-->
<!--April 2-->
<!--• Creating sprites and performing basic 2-D kinematic motion (no gravity, collision, etc)-->
<!--• Develop a working link of communication between the user interface and the physics-->
<!--engine. At this point we will be working with a simplification of the physics problems we-->
<!--plan to solve to ensure all parts will work properly and to what extent they will work.-->
<!--April 9-->
<!--• Write code for all objects and environmental features for problem modeling.-->
<!--Environmental feature include gravity, levels, grounds, etc.-->
<!--• Implement the middleware such that the coordinate system would be set to be relative to-->
<!--other objects given the current environmental details. (Block A is 5 feet to the right of-->
<!--block B given that they are both on the same platform)-->
<!--• At this point given a set of objects and environmental features we would be receiving-->
<!--input data from the user interface and then we would interpret it using our own design-->
<!--paradigm (relative coordinates, etc). All the under-the-hood calculations would be-->
<!--maintained by the middleware communicating with the physics engine (this is to maintain-->
<!--modularity)--with it only giving the frontend certain calculations done by the physics-->
<!--engine to be displayed.-->
<!--April 16-->
<!--• Construct the interface such that the user is given the ability to model their problem using-->
<!--both drag and drop objects and a data input box-->
<!--• Given a model from the user the interface will then call the correct function and obtain-->
<!--the data needed to generate the output.-->
<!--￼-->
<!--• Our goal at this point is to have an interface that is as simple and complete as possible-->
<!--without necessarily implementing the simulations yet. We will also be focusing on-->
<!--making the interface intuitive and minimal.-->
<!--April 23-->
<!--• Finish interface including the simulation aspect of it. This involves using the data-->
<!--received from the physics engine to create the simulation and also includes optimizing-->
<!--how and when we update the simulation (finding the proper balance of space and time-->
<!--used when updating)-->
<!--• Add extra but necessary components to Phys Wiz like a history tab that saves the user’s-->
<!--recently entered problems.-->
<!--April 30-->
<!--• Thoroughly test and debug (having a bunch of random people playing with it would-->
<!--surely be a good method to help test).-->
<!--• Add non-essential features. These are feature that could make the app more fun and user-->
<!--friendly but that are not necessary. This includes possibly integrating a myScript type of-->
<!--interface that allows the user to draw in objects that would then be replaced by the object-->
<!--that most closely resembles what they drew. Another possible expansion may be a-->
<!--custom object option that would allow the user to draw an object that they could then-->
<!--give properties to and create simulations with.-->
<!--May 2-->
<!--• Have demo presentation done and rehearsed-->
