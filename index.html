 <h2>Time Line</h2>
<i>April 2</i>
<p class="tab">
• Creating sprites and performing basic 2-D kinematic motion (no gravity, collision, etc)<br>
• Develop a working link of communication between the user interface and the physics
engine. At this point we will be working with a simplification of the physics problems we
plan to solve to ensure all parts will work properly and to what extent they will work.<br>
</p>
<i>April 9</i>
<p class="tab">
• Write code for all objects and environmental features for problem modeling.
Environmental feature include gravity, levels, grounds, etc. <br>
• Implement the middleware such that the coordinate system would be set to be relative to
other objects given the current environmental details. (Block A is 5 feet to the right of
block B given that they are both on the same platform) <br>
• At this point given a set of objects and environmental features we would be receiving
input data from the user interface and then we would interpret it using our own design
paradigm (relative coordinates, etc). All the under-the-hood calculations would be
maintained by the middleware communicating with the physics engine (this is to maintain
modularity)--with it only giving the frontend certain calculations done by the physics
engine to be displayed. <br>
</p>
<i>April 16</i>
<p class="tab">
• Construct the interface such that the user is given the ability to model their problem using
both drag and drop objects and a data input box <br>
• Given a model from the user the interface will then call the correct function and obtain
the data needed to generate the output. <br>
￼<br>
• Our goal at this point is to have an interface that is as simple and complete as possible
without necessarily implementing the simulations yet. We will also be focusing on
making the interface intuitive and minimal. <br>
</p>
<i>April 23</i>
<p class="tab">
• Finish interface including the simulation aspect of it. This involves using the data
received from the physics engine to create the simulation and also includes optimizing
how and when we update the simulation (finding the proper balance of space and time
used when updating)<br>
• Add extra but necessary components to Phys Wiz like a history tab that saves the user’s
recently entered problems.<br>
</p>
<i>April 30</i>
<p class="tab">
• Thoroughly test and debug (having a bunch of random people playing with it would
surely be a good method to help test). <br>
• Add non-essential features. These are feature that could make the app more fun and user
friendly but that are not necessary. This includes possibly integrating a myScript type of
interface that allows the user to draw in objects that would then be replaced by the object
that most closely resembles what they drew. Another possible expansion may be a
custom object option that would allow the user to draw an object that they could then
give properties to and create simulations with.
</p>
<i>May 2</i>
<p class="tab">
 • Have demo presentation done and rehearsed
